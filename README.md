### What's Done

Basic command system: We've set up the foundational command system, allowing the bot to respond to specific user instructions.
Hot personality switch: Atalia can dynamically change its interaction style according to specific commands, offering a range of 'personalities' to engage with.
Linux server demo: We've provided a demonstration on how to deploy and run the Atalia bot on a Linux server.

### What's Next 

More human-like interactions: While Atalia currently has basic conversational capabilities, we plan on improving these to make interactions feel more like chatting with a human.
Extended command set: We're working on expanding Atalia's command set to increase functionality and flexibility.
Meaningful real-world applications: This is the core reason behind the project's ongoing development. We aim to identify and implement practical, impactful use-cases for Atalia.
