#### What's Done

* **Linux server demo**: We've provided a demonstration on how to deploy and run the Atalia bot on a Linux server.

#### What's Next

* **Extended command set**: We're working on expanding Atalia's command set to increase functionality and flexibility.
* **Meaningful real-world applications**: This is the core reason behind the project's ongoing development. We aim to identify and implement practical, impactful use-cases for Atalia.
